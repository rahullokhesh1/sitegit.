        <h2>Proteins</h2>
        <p>
            Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. Gym-goers should aim to include lean sources of protein in their diet.<br>
            Such As<br>
            chicken, turkey, lean beef, fish, eggs, dairy products, tofu, legumes, and plant-based protein sources like beans and lentils.

        </p>
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p> Carbohydrates provide the energy needed for workouts. Complex carbohydrates like whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats), fruits, vegetables, and starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes) should be part of the diet to provide sustained energy.</p>
        <h2>Healthy Fats</h2>
        <p>Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, support overall health and can be a source of sustained energy.</p>
        <h2> Fiber</h2>
        <p>
            Fiber aids in digestion and helps maintain a feeling of fullness. It's found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
        </p>
        <h2>Hydration</h2>
        <p>
            Staying hydrated is crucial for gym-goers. Water is essential for regulating body temperature and maintaining overall health. Some may also benefit from sports drinks for added electrolytes during intense workouts.
        </p>
        <h2>Pre-Workout Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            Consuming a balanced meal or snack 1-2 hours before a workout can provide energy and support exercise performance. It should include a combination of carbohydrates and protein. Examples include a banana with peanut butter, yogurt with berries, or a turkey and avocado wrap.
        </p>
        <h2>Post-Workout Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            After a workout, it's important to refuel with a meal or snack that includes protein and carbohydrates. This helps with muscle recovery and replenishing glycogen stores. Examples include a protein shake, a turkey and vegetable stir-fry, or a quinoa salad with chickpeas.
        </p>
        <h2>Protein Supplements</h2>
        <p>
            Some gym-goers may find it convenient to supplement their diet with protein shakes or bars to meet their protein needs. However, whole food sources of protein should be the primary focus.
        </p>
        <h2> Portion Control</h2>
        <p>
            Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating, which can hinder progress. Balancing portion sizes with activity level is important.
        </p>
        <h2> Avoid Excess Sugar and Processed Foods</h2>
        <p>
            Limit the intake of sugary drinks, sweets, and highly processed foods. These can lead to energy crashes and may not support your fitness goals.
